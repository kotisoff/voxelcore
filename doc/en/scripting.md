## Type annotations

The documentation for Lua libraries uses type annotations,
not part of Lua syntax.

- vector - an array of three or four numbers
- vec2 - array of two numbers
- vec3 - array of three numbers
- vec4 - array of four numbers
- quat - array of four numbers - quaternion
- matrix - array of 16 numbers - matrix

## Namespaces

Currently, the engine uses a namespace hierarchy that minimizes conflicts between individual modules, scripts, and even packs.

The following structure is relevant:

- Global namespace (_G), which is the root namespace. Writing to it outside of engine core modules is highly undesirable, as it can waste hours of debugging time.
    - Pack namespace - created each time content is loaded for each pack included in the configuration. This namespace is used by modules, as well as item and block scripts.
        - [Component namespace](scripting/ecs.md#built-in-components).
        - [UI document namespace](scripting/ui.md).
- Isolated world generator namespace.

## Modules

A module is a global object with a lifetime limited to the lifetime of the loaded content, used both for interaction between different packages and as a substitute for global variables within the package itself.

The module must be located in `contentpack/modules/**` (subfolders are allowed, but you will need to specify them)

```lua
local module_name = require "contentpack:module_name" -- imports the module

-- If the module is in the same pack in which it is imported, you can use the shortcut:
local module_name = require "module_name"

-- When using nested folders:
local module_name = require "contentpack:path/to/module_name" -- the path does not include `modules`
local module_name = require "path/to/module_name" -- if in the same pack
```

The module will have the namespace of the folder in which it is located, regardless of the namespace from which the first import was performed.

When creating a module, you should follow the following approach, which is what *require* expects:

```lua
local this = {
    variable_name = ... -- public variables
}

-- private module variables
local variable_name = ...

-- private module functions
local function function_name(...)
    ...
end

-- public module functions
function this.function_name(...)
    ...
end

return this -- the result that require will return and cache
```

When reimported, the module will not be reloaded; instead, require will return the cached result.
